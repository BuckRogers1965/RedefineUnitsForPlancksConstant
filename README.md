This project reinterprets Planck’s constant h as a product of unit choices rather than intrinsic mysteries. By redefining h and the speed of light c as unit-derived quantities. Complexities in quantum mechanics and relativity could stem from unit systems.

# Reframing Fundamental Constants: A New Perspective on Energy, Wavelength, and Relativity

## Abstract

This project introduces a novel framework for understanding fundamental constants, particularly Planck’s constant h, as products of unit choices rather than intrinsic mysteries of nature. By redefining constants as unit-derived quantities, this perspective uncovers simpler geometric relationships between energy, wavelength, and relativistic effects. This approach suggests that complexities in quantum mechanics might stem from unit conventions rather than fundamental aspects of physical reality.  

## Key Concepts

1. **Encoding Constants via Division/Multiplication**  
   Constants like h can be seen as encoding simpler physical relationships through unit scaling, analogous to reversible division/multiplication operations.  we can extract the ratio between h and 1/c out by just setting K=hc. 

2. **Planck's Constant as a Unit Scaling Factor**  
   h is reframed as K/c, where K (e.g.,  1.98644568 * 10^-25 J m} acts as a scaling factor in energy-wavelength relationships. This redefinition proposes that h and K arise from unit-based choices rather than being fundamental values.

3. **Redefining Units to Expose Fundamental Relationships**  
   Through a thought experiment setting hc = 1 J m, we redefine the speed of light c and the meter m, revealing insights into how constants interact with unit systems. By finding the meter scaling factor where  h = 1/c, the framework suggests that both constants are emergent from unit scaling.

4. **Revised Equations Using K  as a Scaling Factor**
   - **Geometric-Replacement_for_h**: h = K/c 
   - **Energy-Frequency**: E = K f / c 
   - **Energy-Wavelength**: E = K / wavelength
   - **Reduced Planck Constant**: hbar = K / (2 pi c)
   - **Fine Structure Constant**: alpha = e^2 / (2 epsilon_0 K)

   This reformulation allows K to simplify geometric relationships between energy, frequency, and wavelength.

5. **Relating Wavelength to Time Dilation**  
   In this framework, a particle’s wavelength can encode its time dilation, linking quantum properties with relativistic effects. Thus, energy, typically seen as a scalar, may also reflect geometric factors related to time dilation, providing a bridge between quantum and relativistic models.

## Implementation

To implement these ideas computationally, this project includes:

- A search program that fine-tunes meter redefinitions to achieve a target hc value.
- An algorithm that iteratively adjusts the meter scaling factor to converge on exact values, demonstrating unit dependency of constants like h and c.

This program can be used to explore similar adjustments for other constants, offering a platform for deeper insights into unit-driven frameworks of physical relationships.
