# This program generates a table of frequencies, their corresponding inverse wavelengths (frequency / c),
# and their energy equivalents scaled by hc. Traditionally, the product hc and the appearance of discrete
# energy values have been interpreted as evidence of intrinsic quantization in atomic and subatomic processes.
#
# However, this calculation highlights an alternative interpretation: the apparent "quantization"  
# in energy results from the scaling factor hc applied in reciprocal (hyperbolic) space 
# of 1/wavelength rather than any intrinsic, indivisible energy steps. The non-linear increments in energy 
# arise due to the reciprocal relationship between frequency and wavelength (1/frequency), which projects 
# continuous frequencies into hyperbolic space in a manner that appears quantized when scaled by hc.
#
# Consequently, this perspective suggests that quantization may be an artifact of how energy values are
# represented and scaled within our unit system, rather than an inherent property of energy itself. This 
# program, therefore, offers a different lens for understanding quantum mechanics, where the appearance of 
# discrete energy levels is a result of unit scaling in hyperbolic space.
